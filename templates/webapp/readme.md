# Welcome to Your New CodeOnly Project!

In this folder you'll find:

* `client` - the client side part of your app
* `server` - the ExpressJS server backing your app

To run your project:

* In VS Code, just run the project
* From the command line:
    * npm run dev - runs the site in development mode
    * npm run prod - runs the site in production mode
    * npm run up - runs the site in production mode in a docker container
    * npm run down - stops a previously started docker container

Note, before using `npm run up` you must either `npm run prod` or 
`npm run build` to build the client side app bundle.
